Great question! Here’s why a **static binary** is often easier for deployment, especially for Rust (and Go) applications:

---

### What is a Static Binary?

- A **static binary** is a compiled executable that includes **all** of its dependencies (including the C standard library and any other libraries it uses) inside the binary itself.
- In contrast, a **dynamic binary** depends on shared libraries (.so files) being present on the system where it runs.

---

### Why is a Static Binary Easier for Deployment?

1. **No External Dependencies**

   - You don’t have to worry about which libraries are installed on the target system (EC2, Docker, etc.).
   - The binary will run on any compatible Linux system, regardless of its installed packages.

2. **Fewer Compatibility Issues**

   - No “missing library” errors (e.g., `libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file`).
   - No need to match the target system’s glibc or other library versions.

3. **Simpler Deployment**

   - You can copy just the binary (and your config/assets) to the server—no need to install extra packages or manage dependencies.
   - Works well in minimal environments (e.g., scratch Docker images, Alpine Linux, or stripped-down EC2 AMIs).

4. **Security**
   - Smaller attack surface: fewer libraries loaded at runtime.
   - Easier to use minimal, locked-down environments.

### How to Build a Static Binary in Rust

- Use the `musl` target:
  ```sh
  rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
  cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
  ```
- The resulting binary in `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/` will be fully static.

---

**Summary:**
A static binary “just works” on almost any Linux system, making deployment, troubleshooting, and security much simpler.

Let me know if you want to update your deployment script to use a static binary!
